# Microservices Architecture for Archive and Notification Services

This project demonstrates a microservices architecture using Rust and gRPC for communication between services. The architecture consists of two primary microservices:

1. **Task Service**: Responsible for managing tasks such as creating archives, tracking progress, and stopping tasks.
2. **REST API Service**: Provides a RESTful API for clients to interact with the Task Service and a Notification Service via gRPC.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture is designed to separate concerns and improve scalability and maintainability. Each service is responsible for a specific domain of functionality and communicates with other services via gRPC.

## Services

### Task Service

**Description**: The Task Service handles tasks such as creating zip archives with passwords, tracking the progress of these tasks, and stopping tasks.

**gRPC API**:
- `EnqueueTask`: Accepts a request to create a new task for archiving files.
- `GetTaskProgress`: Returns the progress of a specified task.
- `StopTask`: Stops a specified task.

**Proto File**: `proto/task_service.proto`

### REST API Service

**Description**: The REST API Service provides a RESTful interface for clients to interact with the Task Service and the Notification Service. It forwards requests to the appropriate gRPC services and returns responses to the clients.

**REST Endpoints**:
- `POST /enqueue`: Enqueues a new task to create an archive.
- `GET /archive`: Retrieves a completed archive by task ID.
- `GET /progress`: Gets the progress of a specified task or all tasks.
- `GET /stop`: Stops a specified task.
- `POST /send_notification`: Sends a notification to a specified recipient.

## Configuration

Configuration for the services is stored in a `config.toml` file at the root of the project:

```toml
[task_service]
address = "http://[::1]:50051"

[notification_service]
address = "http://[::1]:50052"
```

## Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo
- Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`)

### Build

1. Generate the gRPC code from the proto files:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Run the Services

1. **Task Service**:

```sh
cd task_service
cargo run --release
```

2. **REST API Service**:

```sh
cd ../rest_api
cargo run --release
```

## Usage

### Enqueue Task

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9188/enqueue" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
     -F "archive_name=my_archive.zip" \
     -F "files=@/path/to/your/file1.txt" \
     -F "files=@/path/to/your/file2.txt"
```

### Get Archive

```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9188/archive?taskId=your_task_id"
```

### Get Progress

```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9188/progress?taskId=your_task_id"
```

### Stop Task

```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9188/stop?taskId=your_task_id"
```

### Send Notification

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9188/send_notification" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Hello, World!", "recipient": "user@example.com"}'
```
